### Exiting the program : `exit`
Exits the program.<br>
Format: `exit`  <br>


### Saving the data 
Daily Planner data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.<br>
There is no need to save manually.

<br> 





## Descriptions and Usage
### Tasks
The daily planner stores all of the users events as a `Task`.

A `Task` can be viewed, added, searched, edited or deleted with the right command word as can be found in [Commands](#commands).

**Every `Task` must consist of a mandatory `TASKNAME` field and optional `START`, `END`, `CATEGORY` fields.**

#### `START` and `END` Field
The `START` and `END` field, if specified, tells the Daily Planner when a task should start and end.
<br>
Both `START` and `END` fields consist of either a `DATE` field, a `TIME` field or both `DATE` `TIME` fields, separated by a whitespace.
<br>
This allows for natural descriptors of starting and ending times.
<br>
The `TIME` field must be given in 12hr am or pm format.
<br>
The following are all valid `START` and `END` fields:
