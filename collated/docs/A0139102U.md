# Features



## Commands 
### Viewing help : `help`
Format: 

```
help
```

> Help is also shown if you enter an incorrect command e.g. `abcd`

### Adding a task : `add`

Adds a task to the planner <br><br>
Format:<br> 
```
1. add TASKNAME s/STARTDATE(optional)
2. add TASKNAME s/STARTDATE(optional) STARTTIME(optional) e/ENDDATE (optional) ENDTIME (optional)
3. add TASKNAME d/STARTDATE(optional) e/ENDDATE(optional) 
```

Examples:<br>

1. `add gym s/today` <br>
> Task with no specified timing is added to today's schedule<br>
 
2. `add meeting s/tomorrow 2pm e/4pm` <br>
> Fixed task is added from 2pm to 4pm the next day<br>

3. `add math homework e/11/11/2016 6pm` <br>
> Task with a deadline is added, no date is specified so today's date is assumed<br>


### Viewing a schedule : `show`

Shows tasks based on query(date or completion)

Format: 

```
show STARTDATE(optional)
```

Examples:<br>
1. `show today`
>Shows schedule for today<br>

2. `show next wednesday`
>Shows schedule for next wednesday <br>

3. `show complete`
>Shows completed tasks <br>

4. `show not complete`
>Shows uncompleted tasks <br>


<br>

The show function will generate the user's schedule when queried. Starting from the current time, it will consider all tasks in hand for the day and assign them to timeslots. 

Urgent tasks will be scheduled first(tasks with nearing deadlines). Fixed tasks will be scheduled only during their specified timeslot and floating tasks will be inserted to remaining empty timeslots throughout the day. Daily Planner will even account for breaks in between certain hours of consecutive tasks(say, every 3 hours). 

The user can then use this recommended schedule to worryless-ly go about their day. 


### Searching for a task: `find`

Searches for a particular task and displays more information about it.<br>

Format: 

```
find TASKNAME
```

Examples:

```
find cs lecture

> * The search is case insensitive.
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `math assignment` will match `assignment math`
> * Only the name is searched.
> * Task matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    e.g. `Hans` will match `Hans Bo`

### Editing a task: `edit`

## Descriptions and Usage
### Tasks
The daily planner stores all of the users events as a `Task`.

A `Task` can be viewed, added, searched, edited or deleted with the right command word as can be found in [Commands](#commands).

**Every `Task` must consist of a mandatory `TASKNAME` field and optional `STARTDATE`, `STARTTIME`, `ENDDATE`, `ENDTIME`, `isRECURRING` fields.**

#### `STARTDATE` and `ENDDATE` Field
The `STARTDATE` and `ENDDATE` field, if specified, tells the Daily Planner which date(s) the task is meant for. If no `ENDDATE` is specified, Daily Planner assumes the task is meant to be done today. 

The `STARTDATE` and `ENDDATE` field can accept natural descriptions of dates. The following are all valid dates:
```

11/11/2016
The 31st of April in the year 2008
Fri, 21 Nov 1997
Jan 21, '97
Sun, Nov 21
jan 1st
february twenty-eighth
next thursday
last wednesday
today
tomorrow
yesterday
next week
next month
next year
3 days from now
three weeks ago
```

#### `STARTTIME` and `ENDTIME` fields

1. No `STARTTIME` or `ENDTIME` fields have to be entered for tasks with no specific timing
2. For a task that must occur within a fixed time period, `STARTTIME` and `ENDTIME` fields must be given in the following format:
    * `s/STARTTIME e/ENDTIME`
    * Example: `s/2pm e/4pm` 
3. For tasks with only a deadline, only the `ENDTIME` has to be entered after `e/` keyword:
    * `e/ENDTTIME`
    * Example: `e/6pm`
4. Both fields require users to specify am or pm after the number.

`STARTTIME` and `ENDTIME` fields can also accept various natural descriptions:

```

6pm
8am

```
```
