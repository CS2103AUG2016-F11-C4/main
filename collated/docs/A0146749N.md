The show function will sort the users's schedule and display it.

### Searching for a task: `find`

Format: 

```
find TASKNAME
```

Examples:

```
find cs lecture
```

> * The search is case insensitive.
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `math assignment` will match `assignment math`
> * Only the name is searched.
> * Task matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    e.g. `math` will match `math lecture`

```
