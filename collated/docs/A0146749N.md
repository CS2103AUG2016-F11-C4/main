### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## Appendix C : Non Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any [mainstream OS](#mainstream-os) as long as it has Java `1.8.0_60` or higher installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 tasks.
3. Should come with automated unit tests and open source code.
4. Should favor DOS style commands over Unix-style commands.
5. Task input should not be more than 200 characters to be concise.

## Appendix D : Glossary

##### Mainstream OS

> Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

##### Private contact detail

> A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others

## Appendix E : Product Survey
Our product survey is researched and presented from our client's point of view - Jim does not use cloud-based platforms and prefers to key in his tasks in a single command line to clicking.

### Viewing a schedule : `show`

Shows tasks on a particular day

Format: 

```
show DATE(optional)
```

Examples:<br>
1. `show today`
>Shows schedule for today<br>
2. `show next wednesday`
>Shows schedule for next wednesday <br>

<br>

The show function will generate the user’s schedule when queried. Starting from the current time, it will consider all tasks in hand for the day and assign them to timeslots. 

Urgent tasks will be scheduled first(tasks with nearing deadlines). Fixed tasks will be scheduled only during their specified timeslot and floating tasks will be inserted to remaining empty timeslots throughout the day. Daily Planner will even account for breaks in between certain hours of consecutive tasks(say, every 3 hours). 

The user can then use this recommended schedule to worryless-ly go about their day. 


### Searching for a task: `find`

Searches for a particular task and displays more information about it.<br>

Format: 

```
find TASKNAME
```

Examples:

```
find cs lecture
```

> * The search is case insensitive.
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `math assignment` will match `assignment math`
> * Only the name is searched.
> * Task matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    e.g. `Hans` will match `Hans Bo`

### Editing a task: `edit`

Edits a particular task’s details<br>
Format:
```
edit DATE(optional) INDEX  
NEWTASKNAME(optional) NEWDATE(optional) NEWSTARTTIME(optional) to NEWENDTIME(optional)
```
Examples:<br>
`edit 2 tomorrow`<br>
  `wednesday 4pm to 6pm`<br>
(only changes date and time)<br>
  
```
