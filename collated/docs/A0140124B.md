#### `STARTTIME` and `ENDTIME` fields

1. No `STARTTIME` or `ENDTIME` fields have to be entered for tasks with no specific timing
2. For a task that must occur within a fixed time period, `STARTTIME` and `ENDTIME` fields must be given in the following format:
    * `STARTTIME to ENDTIME`
    * Example: `2pm to 4pm` 
3. For tasks with only a deadline, only the `ENDTIME` has to be given after a `by` keyword:
    * `by ENDTTIME`
    * Example: `by 6pm`

`STARTTIME` and `ENDTIME` fields can also accept various natural desciptions:

```
0600h
06:00 hours
6pm
5:30 a.m.
5
12:59
23:59
8p
noon

midnight
```

#### `isRECURRING` field

If a recurring `Task` must be described in a command, (e.g. tasks that must occur every week), the optional reccuring field can be entered in the format:

`every CYCLE`,

Where `CYCLE` can be `week` or `month`.

Example Command:

`add cs lecture 2pm to 4pm every week`
